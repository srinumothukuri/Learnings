You can use Percona XtraBackup to create backups of a MySQL database, but you cannot directly restore it to an AWS RDS instance.

AWS RDS does not support external backups directly from tools like XtraBackup. Instead, AWS RDS provides automated backup and restore functionalities through the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or SDKs.

Here's what you can do:

1. Create a Backup with XtraBackup:
Use XtraBackup to create a backup of your MySQL database. This will give you a consistent snapshot of your database that you can use for other purposes, like setting up your own MySQL instance.

2. Restore to a MySQL Instance:
You can restore the XtraBackup to a regular MySQL instance (not RDS) running on AWS EC2 or elsewhere.

3. Migrate to AWS RDS:
Once you have your database running on a MySQL instance, you can then use AWS Database Migration Service (DMS) to migrate your data to an AWS RDS instance.

Steps for Migration:
Set Up DMS:

Set up AWS Database Migration Service. This involves creating a replication instance, source endpoint (your MySQL instance), and target endpoint (your RDS instance).

Create a Migration Task:

Create a migration task in DMS, specifying the source and target endpoints, as well as any transformation tasks if needed.

Start the Migration:

Start the migration task. DMS will continuously replicate data from your source to your target.

Monitor and Complete Migration:

Monitor the progress of the migration task. Once it's caught up with the source, you can stop the replication task and complete the migration.

Remember to thoroughly test your backup and migration process in a non-production environment before attempting it in a production environment. Additionally, consider any downtime and data consistency requirements during the migration process
